# python_scripts-
randome python scripts  mostly for calculating odd things 
calculate randomnes was my first program! 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


You type 5 number separated with space  from 1 to 45  and the script will count how many times needs to found the save given number  ( example :  give 5 numbers for 1-45  and i give  1 22 35 44 18  now the program will run random  generated  numbers base on qrandom and it will count  how many runs  need it to create the same set of the given numbers.   Pointless!
